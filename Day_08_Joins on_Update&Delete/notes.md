# 📘 Day 8 – UPDATE & DELETE Operations in SQL (With Transactions)

Today’s practice focused on performing **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, and **transaction-safe operations** using the `Sales.vSalesPerson` view from **AdventureWorks2022**.  
I learned how to safely modify data, restore original values, delete records using conditions, and use transactions to prevent accidental data loss.
