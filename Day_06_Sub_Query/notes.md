# 🧩 Day 6 – Practicing Subqueries in SQL (SELECT Statement)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand and practice the concept of **Subqueries** (nested queries) in Microsoft SQL Server using the **AdventureWorks2022** sample database.  
Focused on using subqueries inside the **SELECT** statement to filter data efficiently.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query.
- Subqueries can be used in:
  - `SELECT`
  - `INSERT`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
  - `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses
- In this session, I practiced **subqueries with the SELECT statement**.

- `[HumanResources].[EmployeePayHistory]`
- `[Production].[Product]`
- `[Production].[ProductInventory]`
