### 🧩 Topics Covered
- WHERE clause
- ORDER BY clause
- COUNT, GROUP BY
- HAVING with GROUP BY

### 🧠 Practice Summary
I used the **AdventureWorks2022** sample database and performed various SQL queries to understand data filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.

### 🗂️ Key Queries
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `!=`, `< >`, and `IS NULL`
- Sorting data using `ORDER BY` (ASC/DESC)
- Grouping results using `GROUP BY`
- Filtering groups using `HAVING`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`

### 💾 Output
- Practiced on tables like:  
  `Person.Address`, `Person.Person`, `HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory`, `Production.ProductCostHistory`, and `Production.Product`
- Verified results with row counts and conditions
