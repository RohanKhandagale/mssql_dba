# Day 2 – Creating My First SQL Server Database

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to create a new database in Microsoft SQL Server using both the **SSMS GUI** and **T-SQL script**, and understand the database configuration settings.

---

## 🧩 Steps Performed

### 1. Created Database Using SSMS GUI
- Opened **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
- Connected to local instance `(local)\MSSQLSERVER`.
- Right-clicked **Databases → New Database**.
- Entered name: **OurFirstDatabase**.
- Verified file paths and options.
- Clicked **OK** to create.

---

### 2. Generated SQL Script
After creating the database, used:
> Right-click → Script Database As → CREATE To → New Query Editor Window

This produced the following script (saved as `create_database_script.sql`):

- Defines data and log files with specific file sizes and growth.
- Sets various database options (ANSI settings, recovery model, page verify, etc.).
- Sets **RECOVERY model = SIMPLE** for easy log management.
- Configures **AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS** and **AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS** for optimization.

## 🧠 Learning Notes

- A SQL Server database consists of:
  - **Primary data file (.mdf)** – stores schema and data.
  - **Log file (.ldf)** – stores transactions.
- The **recovery model** determines how transactions are logged and backed up.
- Options like `AUTO_SHRINK` and `AUTO_CLOSE` should remain **OFF** for production databases.
- Always review scripts generated by SSMS to understand what happens behind GUI operations.

## ✅ Verification Query

To confirm the database creation:

```sql
SELECT name, create_date 
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'OurFirstDatabase';
